# Benchmarks

The development team behind AICSImageIO care deeply about read time. We personally
understand that it is a pretty common experience of simply trying to load a file into
memory and that read resulting in minutes of waiting if the file is large enough.

These benchmarks are our attempt at ensuring we have comparable or better read times
than the other common microscopy image reading libraries:
* [imageio](https://github.com/imageio/imageio)
* [tifffile](https://github.com/cgohlke/tifffile)
* [czifile](https://pypi.org/project/czifile/)

## Results
![aicsimageio read times](_static/benchmarks/3.1.4-primary.png)
_Full image read time (seconds) against number of YX planes in the image._
_(Lower is better)_
_aicsimageio.imread read times in blue and_
_imageio.imread, czifile.imread, or tifffile.imread read times in orange_

### Configs
* `no-cluster`: single-threaded, no `distributed.Client` connection available
* `small-local-cluster-replica`: simulates a `distributed.LocalCluster` on common
  workstations at AICS. Eight (8) cores available to the Dask workers.
* `many-small-worker-distributed-cluster`: simulates the normal cluster setup that is
  preferred for large workloads. 128 Dask workers, each with one (1) core available.

## Discussion
Currently, single threaded full image reads are incredibly slow in comparison to the
other tested libraries. We assume this is due to how each plane read reopens, and
re-indexes the file prior to returning the data. However, even on a standard workstation
(8 cores available), `aicsimageio`, is comparable or outperforms the other libraries in
raw read time. And following this trend, the more workers you provide to the cluster,
the better it gets. With 128 workers reading ~500 YX plane files (~400MB) in about 10
seconds.

We are actively working on addressing single-threaded performance but want to emphasize
that spawning a `LocalCluster` to speed up file reads is as easy as:
```
from aicsimageio import imread, dask_utils

with dask_utils.cluster_and_client() as (cluster, client):
   img = imread("my_file.tiff")
```

## Historical Benchmarks
Benchmarks will be ran and published at least every "minor" release.

## Running the Tests
If you are interested in how we run our benchmarks please see the
[benchmark.py](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio/scripts/benchmark.py)
and [chart_benchmarks.py](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio/scripts/chart_benchmarks.py)
files.

Unfortunately, these scripts utilize a
[SLURM cluster](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) to construct the various Dask
cluster configurations. If you have a different HPC cluster at your organization or
prefer using a cloud deployment and wish to run these tests yourself, please see
[dask_jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/) and
[dask_cloudprovider](https://cloudprovider.dask.org/en/latest/) and swap out the
`SLURMCluster` object for whichever object works best for you. Regardless of underlying
compute, we feel it safe to say the results should be fairly similar to what is
presented in this document.
